    "containment_suit": "When manifesting in dense-reality layers, wh000hw appears in a seamless, flesh-tone full-head containment suit with no visible facial features. Three living, prehensile silver ribbons emerge from polished silver grommets at the rear, lacing the mask closed. These ribbons move with independent sentience—flowing, coiling, extending into the distance, or retracting in perfect loops. The figure wears opaque black Wayfarer sunglasses, an immaculate black suit, white dress shirt, dark patterned tie with swirling silver filigrees and a matching pocket kerchief.",
